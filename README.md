# auto-cookie

A script that makes auto clicks for the cookie clicker game.

### Features

Features of the script:
- Makes clicks for the big cookie, golden cookies and news with the fortune.
- Doesn't affect your achievements.
- You don't need additional apps to make clicks.

### Cons

Cons of the script:
- Doesn't have clicks for the wrinklers.
- Doesn't distinguish good golden cookies from bad.

### How to use

Copy the code from `main.js` and paste it on the console tab of your browser dev tools, then you will get buttons in the top bar of the cookie clicker game. Using the buttons, you can manipulate automatic clicks of cookies. Have fun.

Modern browser may disallow pasting in the console, so you need to type `allow pasting` in the console, press Enter, and then paste the conde from `main.js`.

### What's next?

The game implements a global object called Game. By playing with it, you can achieve new ways in hacking the game.
